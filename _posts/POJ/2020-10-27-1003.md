### **Description**

How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below.

### **Input**
The input consists of one or more test cases, followed by a line containing the number 0.00 that signals the end of the input. Each test case is a single line containing a positive floating-point number c whose value is at least 0.01 and at most 5.20; c will contain exactly three digits.

### **Output**
For each test case, output the minimum number of cards necessary to achieve an overhang of at least c card lengths. Use the exact output format shown in the examples.
Sample Input

### **Sample Input**
```

```

### **Sample Output**
```

### **Source**
``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        double len = 0;
        while((len = in.nextDouble()) != 0.0) {
            System.out.println(cards(len) + " card(s)");
            in.nextLine();
        }
        in.close();
    }

    private static int cards(double len) {
        int i = 2;
        double res = 0;
        while(res < len) {
            res += 1.0 / i++;
        }
        return i - 2;
    }
}
```
